        I use a structured "single source of truth" (SSOT) catalog to define
        clinical concepts. It contains metric types (KPIs like door-to-needle
        time, length of stay, scores such as NIHSS and mRS), stroke types,
        chart types, grouping dimensions, operators, boolean flags, statistical
        tests, and sex categories. You can ask me what these concepts mean or
        use them in queries like "Show DTN by stroke type".

  utter_faq_metric_types:
    - text: >-
        Metric types define the KPIs you can query. They cover time intervals
        (for example door-to-needle or door-to-groin times and award metrics
        such as AA_DTN_LE60), clinical scores (like NIHSS, mRS, and functional
        outcome scales), visit-level measures (length of stay, readmission and
        mortality rates), vital signs and labs (blood pressure, glucose,
        cholesterol), treatment and workflow flags (thrombolysis,
        thrombectomy, recanalization, imaging done, swallowing screening), and
        many more. Each metric has a canonical code (such as AGE or
        ADMISSION_NIHSS), a set of human-friendly synonyms, a data type
        (numeric or categorical), and metadata like units and valid ranges.

  utter_faq_stroke_types:
    - text: >-
        Stroke types classify the kind of cerebrovascular event. Typical
        categories include ischaemic stroke (a blocked blood vessel),
        intracerebral haemorrhage (bleeding into brain tissue), subarachnoid
        haemorrhage (bleeding around the brain, often from an aneurysm),
        cerebral venous thrombosis (a clot in a cerebral vein), transient
        ischaemic attack or "mini-stroke" where symptoms resolve, stroke
        mimics (conditions that look like stroke but are not), and
        undetermined strokes where the exact type is unclear. You can use
        these categories as filters or groupings in your queries.

  utter_faq_chart_types:
    - text: >-
        Chart types control how results are visualised. Common options include
        line charts for trends over time, bar charts for comparing categories,
        box plots for distributions and outliers, histograms for frequency
        distributions, scatter plots for relationships between two measures,
        pie charts for composition, radar or spider charts for comparing
        multiple KPIs across a few groups, waterfall charts for cumulative
        effects, and area charts for stacked time series. You can choose a
        chart type explicitly in your request or let the system pick a default
        based on the question.

  utter_faq_group_by_types:
    - text: >-
        Group-by types describe the dimensions you can use to break results
        down into subgroups. Examples include EMS prenotification status,
        first contact place or initial point of contact, the department where
        thrombolysis was given, the department of admission, arrival mode,
        stroke subtype, and other workflow, demographic, or organisational
        fields. In practice, you can ask for things like "DTN by stroke type",
        "LOS by admission department", or "mortality rate by EMS
        prenotification".

  utter_faq_statistical_test_types:
    - text: >-
        Statistical test types describe the methods available for comparing
        groups or measuring associations. They include classical tests such as
        t-tests and ANOVA for comparing means, chi-squared and Fisher's exact
        tests for categorical associations, non-parametric tests like
        Mann–Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Kruskal–Wallis, and Friedman for
        ordinal or non-normal data, correlation measures such as Pearson,
        Spearman, and Kendall tau, regression models including linear,
        logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression, and diagnostic
        tests like Shapiro–Wilk for normality and Levene's test for equality
        of variances, plus McNemar's test for paired categorical data.

  utter_faq_operator_types:
    - text: >-
        Operator types define how numeric or categorical filters are applied.
        Common operators include GE (greater than or equal), LE (less than or
        equal), GT (greater than), LT (less than), EQ (equal to), and NE (not
        equal to). In natural language you use them when you say things like
        "age above 65", "NIHSS less than 4", or "LOS equal to 3 days". The
        system maps these phrases onto the appropriate operator when building
        filters.

  utter_faq_sex_types:
    - text: >-
        Sex types represent biological sex categories used in the data.
        Typically these include male, female, other or non-binary, and
        unknown or not provided. You can use them to filter or group
        statistics, for example "DTN for female patients" or "stroke type by
        sex".

  utter_faq_boolean_types:
    - text: >-
        Boolean types are yes/no style indicators that describe whether a
        particular condition or workflow step applies. Examples include flags
        for whether thrombolysis or thrombectomy was performed, whether
        imaging or swallowing screening was done, whether EMS prenotification
        occurred, or whether certain risk factors or medications were present.
        They are represented as true/false values internally but can be used
        naturally in questions like "patients who did receive thrombolysis" or
        "cases without EMS prenotification".
